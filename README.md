# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

Welcome to my solutions for the **Advent of Code 2023** challenges, implemented in **JavaScript**. This repository contains my solutions for each dayâ€™s puzzle, along with explanations and example usage.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/msimundza/adventOfCode2023.git
    ```
    then navigate to the cloned repository
    ```cd adventOfCode2023```

2. Ensure you have Node.js installed. If not, download and install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

3. Install the necessary dependencies (if any) by running:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Solutions

Each solution is implemented in a separate file for each day. To run the solution for a specific day, you can use Node.js.

For example, to run the solution for Day 2:

```bash
node src/2_1.js
```

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**: I am currently working through the challenges and have completed solutions up to **Day 10**. I will be updating this repository as I progress through the remaining challenges.
